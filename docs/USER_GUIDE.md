# User guide

openASC currently provides a local content inventory tool. There is no playable engine or scene viewer yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Your own installed copy of Assetto Corsa (2014) to inspect game content.
- No third-party Python packages.

The website and automated tests work without an installation of the game.

## Get the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openASC-project/openASC.git
cd openASC
```

Keep your installation outside the repository, or use the ignored `assettocorsa/` directory. The scanner accepts either location.

## Inspect your installation

Run from the repository root:

```sh
python tools/inspect_content.py ./assettocorsa
```

For an installation elsewhere, pass its root directory in quotes:

```powershell
python tools/inspect_content.py "D:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/assettocorsa"
```

The tool expects both `content/cars` and `content/tracks`. It lists immediate content directories and checks for UI metadata, KN5 files, model configuration files, and packed or unpacked car data. It does not read geometry or simulate a vehicle.

## Save a report

```sh
python tools/inspect_content.py ./assettocorsa --output reports/content.json
```

The output contains content-relative paths rather than the absolute installation path. Reports are ignored by Git. The tool refuses to overwrite an existing output file or write a report inside the game installation. Use a new filename for another scan.

## Understand the results

- `scope: file_presence_only` means the report only records file presence.
- `counts` counts content directories, not verified playable cars or track layouts.
- `kn5_present` checks for KN5 files directly inside a content directory.
- `ui_metadata_present` checks the default UI metadata path; individual track-layout metadata is not inspected.
- Data archive presence does not imply ACD decoding support.

## Troubleshooting

An invalid installation path exits with code 2. Check that you passed the game root, rather than `content/` or the repository root. Permission errors are reported without changing the installation.

For bugs, open an [issue](https://github.com/openASC-project/openASC/issues) with the command, Python version, and error. Review reports before sharing them; do not attach game assets or third-party mods.
