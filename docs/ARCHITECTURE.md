# Architecture

The implemented project is currently a Python inventory tool and a static documentation website. The engine modules below are a proposed design, not existing runtime features.

## Implemented components

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/inspect_content.py` | Read-only content inventory and JSON CLI |
| `tests/` | Tests using original, temporary fixtures |
| `docs/` | English documentation and current compatibility record |
| `web/` | Shared website template and overview source |
| `tools/build_site.py` | Build documentation pages using Python's standard library |
| `site/` | Generated HTML, shared CSS/JS, and public static assets |
| `.github/workflows/` | Source checks and GitHub Pages deployment |

## Proposed engine boundaries

- **Content:** configuration readers, resource resolution, metadata, and precise loading diagnostics.
- **Scene:** geometry, material definitions, transforms, surfaces, and collision data independent of a renderer.
- **Render:** scene inspection, camera, lighting, and material preview.
- **Simulation:** fixed simulation step, drivetrain, suspension, aerodynamics, and tyres.
- **Platform:** windowing, clocks, input devices, and force feedback.
- **Application:** content selection, session setup, diagnostics, and the driving loop.

Keep file-format readers separate from rendering and physics so each can be tested without opening a window. Unsupported resources should produce diagnostics rather than silently appearing compatible.

## Technology choices

Python keeps the initial tools dependency-free. The engine stack has not been selected. Rust with wgpu is one candidate to evaluate with the first viewer prototype; no renderer or Rust engine currently exists in this repository.

## Website

The website uses a shared documentation layout inspired by [openomsi.org](https://openomsi.org/): persistent navigation, a project overview, and dedicated documentation pages. Its original visual styling uses a charcoal, red, and white motorsport palette, italic branding, and a dark default theme. The implementation and content are original to openASC.

Documentation pages are generated from the same Markdown files that appear on GitHub. Run `python tools/build_site.py` after editing documentation or the shared template, then commit the generated HTML. Relative assets work beneath `/openASC/` on GitHub Pages.
